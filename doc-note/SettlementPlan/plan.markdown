# Why  I want to immigrate to Saskatchewan#

## Why choose Canda? ##

Firstly, to be a professional software developer, I have been working for ten years in Beijing. But the air polution in Beijing is very serious, I think that factor would be bad for my future family and myself, especially raising children, and Canada is a ideal place to live and work. Secondly, Canada is the second largest country in the world with many gorgeous landscapes, and without too much population, because I prefer to a more quiet and peaceful life. Lastly, Canada is a free, highly developed country with the great health and welfare programs, and due to many opportunities in the Information Technology sector for software professionals, I can easily find my desired job position. Otherwise, Living in another different country is a extremely chanllenging thing to accomplish!  Therefore, I pick Canada as my new home.

## About Saskatchewan ##

Saskatchewan is a land of natural beauty that is rich in resources and full of opportunities for study, quality careers, or starting a business. I think Saskatchewan is a great place for me and my future family to call home, and Regina would be the place where we choose to live. Regina’s comfortable size will give me more chances to explore and entertain, whether it’s walking around Wascana Lake, going to the movies or the art gallery, relaxing in the sun at nearby Regina Beach or skiing in the winter, and enjoy the favorite activities---Mosaic, a popular multicultural festival held every spring. It will be a great place to meet other immigrants who live there!

# Before I leave #

Before leaving from China, There are some fundamental learning works need to do.

##Knowing more about Life in Canada ##

As a new immigrant to Canada, it is important to know about Canada’s history, the land, climate, people, government, and laws and justice. We should understand both the rights and responsibilities of the people who live here. It is essential for us to learn rights and responsibilities of living in Saskatchewan as to adapt to the new culture.

### Rights in Canada ###

When I arrive in Canada and begin our life in Saskatchewan, I will have certain rights and protections under Canadian, provincial and local laws.
Some of those rights and freedoms include:

* The right to life, liberty and personal security
* Freedom of conscience and religion
* Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media
* Protection from unreasonable search or seizure and unjustified detainment and imprisonment
* The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
* The right to retain and instruct counsel (a lawyer) without delay

### Responsibilities  ###

Besides rights I will get in Canada, there are also responsibilities I have to take. Threrefore I also have legal obligations. It is important to know how the laws affect me in terms of both rights and obligations. The government system and its programs will be of interest to us as I begin to receive benefits and to pay taxes.

### Others ###

Other information about starting life in Canada can be easily accessed in [Welcome to Canada](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/pub/welcome.pdf)

7. Driver’s license, including an International Driver’s Permit and a reference from my auto insurance company

## Finding a temporary residence  ##

In order to be convenient, I will check and search for suitable temporary residential places prior to my landing in Canada. I can use these links to find a temporary residence in Regina:

* Present two copies of a list of items that are arriving later and their money value.
* Have two border crossing interviews. 
* Report to the CBSA if bringing CAN$10,000 or more.

# After landing #

## Immediate to-do list##

When I arrive at the new country, there are some essential things:

* Buy private insurance within five days of arriving, and waiting for health insurance coverage to begin.
* Apply for a public health card.
* Apply for a Social Insurance Number (SIN).
* Open a Canadian bank account and apply for a credit card so I can begin to establish my credit history in Canada.
* Exchange my money for Canadian currency. 
* Get a map of your area and find out about public transportation.
* Prepare to get my education and work credentials recognized in Canada.
* Find immigrant-serving organizations in my community with many of the steps in my settlement plan including language training and finding work.

## Renting a house ##

To rent a house is an essential step to have a normal living in Saskatchewan. So I can find it via internet resources:

[properties.mitula.ca](http://properties.mitula.ca)

I will choose an area which is not far away from the university of Regina and Wascana Lake. I may signed one or six months's rental contract. When my full time work is confirmed, I will reconsider the location where I will live.

##  Buying a house ##

This linkis also okay:

[properties.mitula.ca](http://properties.mitula.ca)

Since housing varies greatly between areas and communities, houses for sale in Regina with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms could be marked a price between $200,000 and $600,000, it can be a challenge for new arrivals like me to buy an ideal home, our budget for buying a home would be around $500,000.

Before buying a home, we have to decide how much we can afford, how many rooms we will need, where we’d like to live and what type of housing my family prefer.

After living in Regina for a while, I am sure we could find a safe, affordable area to live and have a better idea of the condition and its worth of a home.

## Working ##

Finding a job in Canada can take time and may be different from finding a job in our home country. We need to apply a Social Insurance Number so that I can work and get access to government service. To apply for my Social Insurance Number (SIN), we simply need to gather all the required original proof-of-identity documents and take them to the nearest Service Canada point of service.

### Some resources I can use ###

* I can use the **Working in Canada** Tool ([www.workingincanada.gc.ca](http://www.workingincanada.gc.ca) ) to get information on the Canadian job market.
* I also could use [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) to find my ideal job.

### Gathering Certificated Documents ###
I will collect all my certificated documents, such as college's GPA result, diplomas and my current and previous team leader's reference letters.

### My competency ###
As an experienced software programmer, besides the offical engineering trainning and diplomas I got in college, I have also aquired abundant developing technologies and related experiences in my career life. I am familar with C, C++ and Java programming languages. I developed softwares and debuged on mutiple operating systems, such as Windows desktop, Windows CE and linux. At present, I have been working on android phone development for five years, I have had the deep understanding of Android smartphone's software stack and hardware's architecture. Therefore the most matched job position for me is Android related jobs, including the entire platform development or Android application development. I strongly believe that I can  get my desired job in SK.
