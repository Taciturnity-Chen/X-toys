# Why  I want to immigrate to Saskatchewan#

## Why choose Canada? ##

Firstly, as a professional software programmer, I have been working in IT field for ten years in Beijing. But, as you may know, the air polution in Beijing is very serious, which would have bad effect on the health of myself and my future family, especially it is not a good place for raising children. And Canada, as the second largest country in the world with many gorgeous landscapes, and not much population, is an ideal place for me and my prospective family to live in and work at. Secondly, I prefer a more quiet and peaceful life which Beijing, as the political, economic and cultural center, cannot provide. Thirdly, due to many opportunities in the Information Technology sector for software professionals, I believe I can easily find a desired job in the near future after my arrival. Fourthly, Canada is a free, and highly developed country with great health and welfare programs. Besides, living in another different country is an extremely challenging thing to accomplish!  Therefore, I pick Canada as my new home.

## About Saskatchewan ##

Saskatchewan is a province which has many beautiful natural scenes in Canada, and it receives more hours of sunshine than any other Canadian province. With the highest employment rate in Canada and comfortable climate, It's an ideal place to work, live and study. As a cultural and commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan, Regina would be the city which I choose to live. The moderate city scale can greatly decrease the commuting time,  Wascana Lake can bring more beautiful city landscapes and entertaining places, University of Regina provides more educational resources and enhances city's cultural atmosphere. After investigations, although I have never been to Regina, I find I have fallen in love with it!

# Before I leave #

Before leaving from China, There are some fundamental things I need to do.

##Knowing more about Life in Canada ##

As a new immigrant to Canada, it is important to know about Canada’s history, land, climate, people, government, and laws and justice. We should understand both the rights and responsibilities of the people who live here. It is essential for me to learn rights and responsibilities of living in Saskatchewan as to adapt to the new culture.

### Rights in Canada ###

When I arrive in Canada and begin my new life in Saskatchewan, I will have certain rights and protections under Canadian, provincial and local laws.
Some of those rights and freedoms include:

* The right to life, liberty and personal security
* Freedom of conscience and religion
* Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media
* Protection from unreasonable search or seizure and unjustified detainment and imprisonment
* The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
* The right to retain and instruct counsel (a lawyer) without delay

### Responsibilities  ###

Besides rights I will get in Canada, there are also responsibilities I have to take. Therefore I also have legal obligations. It is important to know how the laws affect me in terms of both rights and obligations. The government system and its programs will be of interest to us as I begin to receive benefits and to pay taxes.

### Others ###

Other information about starting life in Canada can be easily accessed in [Welcome to Canada](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/pub/welcome.pdf)

In order to be convenient, I will check and search for suitable temporary residential places prior to my landing in Canada. I can use these links to find a temporary residence in Regina:

# After landing #

## Immediate to-do list##

When I arrive at the new country, there are some essential things:

* Buy private insurance within five days of arriving, and waiting for health insurance coverage to begin.
* Apply for a public health card.
* Apply for a Social Insurance Number (SIN).
* Open a Canadian bank account and apply for a credit card so I can begin to establish my credit history in Canada.
* Exchange my money for Canadian currency.

## Renting a house ##

To rent a house is an essential step to have a normal living in Saskatchewan. So I can find it via internet resources:

[properties.mitula.ca](http://properties.mitula.ca)

I will choose an area which is not far from the university of Regina and Wascana Lake. I may sign a one year's or six months' rental contract. When my full time work is confirmed, I will reconsider the location where I will live.

##  Buying a house ##

This link is also okay for buying a house:

[properties.mitula.ca](http://properties.mitula.ca)

Since housing varies greatly between areas and communities, houses for sale in Regina with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms could be marked a price between $200,000 and $600,000, it can be a challenge for new arrivals like me to buy an ideal home, my budget for buying a home would be around $500,000.

Before buying a home, we have to decide how much we can afford, how many rooms we will need, where we’d like to live and what type of housing my family prefer.

After living in Regina for a while, I am sure I could find a safe, affordable area to live.

## Working ##

Finding a job in Canada can take time and may be different from finding a job in our home country. We need to apply a Social Insurance Number so that I can work and get access to government service. To apply for my Social Insurance Number (SIN), we simply need to gather all the required original proof-of-identity documents and take them to the nearest Service Canada point of service.

### Some resources I can use ###

* I can use the **Working in Canada Tool** ([www.workingincanada.gc.ca](http://www.workingincanada.gc.ca) ) to get information on the Canadian job market.
* I also could use [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) to find an ideal job.

### Gathering Certifited Documents ###
I will collect all my certified documents, such as college's GPA result, undergraduate diploma, bachelor degree and my current and previous team leader's reference letters.

### My competency ###
As an experienced software programmer, besides the academic engineering training and degree I got in college, I have also acquired abundant developing technologies and related experience in my career life. I am familiar with programming languages, such as C, C++ and Java. I helped developing many softwares and debugging on mutiple operating systems, such as Windows desktop, Windows CE and linux. At present, I have been working on android phone development projects for five years, I have had deep understanding of Android Smartphone's software stack and hardware's architecture. Therefore the most matched job positions for me would be Android related jobs, including the entire platform development or Android application development. I strongly believe that I can  get my desired job in SK.

## Languages issues ##

Canada has two official languages: English and French, and English is the main language spoken in the majority of provinces and territories. I realize that strong skills in languages are very important to my prospective life in Canada, such as getting a job, accessing services, helping your children with school work, as well as meeting and interacting with people. Consider improving my English after arriving in Regina, I have already found some immigrant-serving organizations in the city, and they can help me find the information and services we need to start my new life, including language training and help finding work:

**Regina Open Door Society**
Add: 2332 11th Avenue Regina SK S4P 0K1

Telephone: 306-352-3500

**Services**:

Language assessment/Language training (general)/Help with daily life/Find or become a mentor to a newcomer/Services for refugees/Services for Youth

## Education ##

Adult education is common in Canada and there are many education programs available for adults. I wish to use adult education to train for a new job or to improve the skills I already have. [The Regina Open Door Society](http://rods.sk.ca/)  which was mentioned in the previous section also can offer me some courses about career skills.

## Health ##

Canada’s health insurance system is set up to respond to people’s need for health care rather than their ability to pay for it. Often referred to as medicare, the system is designed to make sure that all residents of Canada have reasonable access to health care from doctors and hospitals.

Canada’s public health care system is funded through taxes and administered by the provinces and territories.

To access health care under this system I must apply a health card issued by the government of the province or territory where I live as soon as possible when I arrive Canada. In order to apply Health Insurance card, I should fill the application form that can be found in an immigrant-serving organization in Saskatchewan.  The required documents also include Permanent Resident Card, Passport, Confirmation of Permanent Residence and so forth.  Then I can apply health card online [http://www.ehealthsask.ca/HealthRegistries/Pages/apply-for-health-card.aspx](http://www.ehealthsask.ca/HealthRegistries/Pages/apply-for-health-card.aspx)

## Family ##

Currently, I still don't have a family, so maybe I will get married in the future in Saskatchewan. And the family issues is a long-term process:

### Getting a marriage ###

When I am ready for getting married, I will collect all my and my prospective wife's related documents to get the  Marriage Certificate. This link includes many instructions and tutorials about marriage issues: [http://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/marriages](http://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/marriages).

### Having a baby ###

If we decide to have a baby, we will learn enough knowledges to let babies healthy. Then I am going to get the birth certificate, and the helpful instructions is from [http://www.ehealthsask.ca/vitalstats/births/ordercertificate/Pages/default.aspx](http://www.ehealthsask.ca/vitalstats/births/ordercertificate/Pages/default.aspx).


## Money ##

I prepared about $13,000 to support me in the first six months after I arrive in Canada. The main cost I assumed is the cost of renting. It also includes heating, electricity, telephone, water, food and transportation, etc. Below data is my statistics from my investigations on internet:

### Cost per month ###

|*Item*|*Cost*|
|---|:---|
|Renting the apartment|$900|
|Food|$100|
|Public Transportation|$20|
|Internet & Mobile phone|$60|
|Other fees |$100|
|Entertainment|$150|
|Total budget|$1430|


## Connecting ##

Connecting with other residents in the new community is an important step in the settling process. Making new friends and contacts will help me feel at home in Canada and help me advance my professional goals by creating a network of people who would be helpful in my career life. There are many different ways in which I can connect with others in my new city or town.

### Sports and Leisure Programs ###

I can join fitness centers or gyms around my community; City neighborhoods are organized into Community Associations that offer low-cost exercise, sports and special-interest programs for adults and children.

### Outdoor Recreation ###

Saskatchewan offers year-round outdoor recreation. Provincial parks in many areas allow camping and picnics.  Many communities have parks, play areas and outdoor wading pools for children.  Hunting and fishing are popular outdoor sports, but I must hunt only in certain seasons and follow specific laws that regulate each activity.

### Volunteering ###

When I work as a volunteer, I am donating my time to an organization, person or group of people. I can do volunteer work in many places, such as care-homes where senior citizens live, schools, or for a charity.  My Regional Newcomer Gateway may also be able to help me find opportunities to volunteer.

I can learn more about volunteer in [volunteer.ca](http://volunteer.ca/)
