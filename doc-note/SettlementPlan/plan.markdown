# Why  I want to immigrate to Saskatchewan#

## Why choose Canada? ##

Firstly, as a professional software programmer, I have been working in IT field for ten years in Beijing. But, as you may know, the air polution in Beijing is very serious, which would have bad effect on the health of myself and my future family, especially it is not a good place for raising children. And Canada, as the second largest country in the world with many gorgeous landscapes, and not much population, is an ideal place for me and my prospective family to live in and work at. Secondly, I prefer a more quiet and peaceful life style which Beijing, as the political, economic and cultural center, cannot provide. Thirdly, due to many opportunities in the Information Technology sector for software professionals, I believe I can easily find a desired job in the near future after my arrival. Fourthly, Canada is a free and highly developed country with great health and welfare programs. Besides, living in another different country is an extremely challenging thing to accomplish!  Therefore, I pick Canada as my new home.

## About Saskatchewan and Regina ##

Saskatchewan is a province which has many beautiful natural scenes, and receives more sunshine than any other Canadian province. And with the highest employment rate in Canada and comfortable climate, it is an ideal place to work, live and study.

However, Regina, as a cultural and commercial center for southern Saskatchewan, would be the city which I choose to live in. Its moderate city scale can greatly decrease the commuting time. Wascana Lake can bring more beautiful city landscapes and entertaining places. University of Regina provides more educational resources and enhances city's cultural atmosphere. After investigation, although I have never been to Regina, I find I have fallen in love with it!

# Before I leave #

Before leaving from China, There are some fundamental things I need to do.

##Knowing more about Canada ##

Before leaving from China, it is very important for me to know about Canada’s history, land, climate, people, government, and laws and justice. Especially it is essential for me to learn and understand rights and responsibilities, making preparation for adapting to the new culture.

### Rights in Canada ###

I learned that when I arrive in Canada and begin my new life in Saskatchewan, I would have certain rights and protections under Canadian, federal and provincial laws.
Some of those rights and freedoms include:

* The right to life, liberty and personal security
* Freedom of conscience and religion
* Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media
* Protection from unreasonable search or seizure and unjustified detainment and imprisonment
* The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
* The right to retain and instruct counsel (a lawyer) without delay

### Responsibilities  ###

Besides rights I will get in Canada, there are also responsibilities I have to take. Therefore I also have legal obligations. It is important to know how the laws affect me in terms of both rights and obligations. The government system and its programs will be of interest to us as I begin to receive benefits and to pay taxes.

### Others ###

Other information about starting life in Canada can be easily accessed in [Welcome to Canada](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/pub/welcome.pdf) 

## Gathering all necessary documents  ##

Through searching, collecting and analyzing information from the Internet, especially Canadian immigration website and related websites, I found that before leaving from China, I should have following objects prepared:

1. My aassport which I will use to apply for the visa.
2. My birth certificate.
3. My Bachelor Degree & Undergraduate Diploma & Undergraduate Transcript & ECA report & other related materials
4. Letters of reference from my former employers and current employer
5. My immunization or vaccination record
6. My driver’s license
7. Two copies of a detailed list of all the personal or household items I will bring.

## Finding a temporary residence  ##

In order to be convenient, I will check and search for suitable temporary residential places prior to my landing in Canada. I can use these links to find a temporary residence in Regina:

[http://www.ihg.com/destinations/us/en/canada/saskatchewan/regina-hotels](http://www.ihg.com/destinations/us/en/canada/saskatchewan/regina-hotels) 
[regina.en.craigslist.ca](http://regina.en.craigslist.ca) 

# Crossing the border #

After searching and analyzing, I found following things to be taken into consideration:

* Carry all the above important documents
* Present a Canadian immigrant visa, a Confirmation of Permanent Residence, and my valid passport
* Present two copies of a list of items that are arriving later and their money value
* Have two border crossing interviews
* Report to the CBSA if bringing CAN$10,000 or more.

# After landing #

## Immediate to-do list##

Via investigation, I found that when I arrive at the new country, there are some essential things to be done immediately:

* Buy private insurance within five days of arriving.
* Apply for a public health card.
* Apply for a Social Insurance Number (SIN).
* Open a Canadian bank account and apply for a credit card.
* Exchange my money for Canadian currency. 
* Get a map of your area and find out about public transportation.
* Prepare to get my education and work credentials recognized in Canada.
* Find immigrant-serving organizations.
* Get a copy of The Saskatchewan Driver's Handbook, learn Saskatchewan Traffic Safety Act and take exams to get a driver license.  

## Renting a house ##

Renting a house is an essential step to have a normal life in Saskatchewan. I believe I can find a suitable place via internet resources:

[properties.mitula.ca](http://properties.mitula.ca)

I will choose an area which is not far from the university of Regina and Wascana Lake. I may sign a one-year or six-months rental contract. When my full time job is confirmed, I will reconsider the location where I will live.

##  Buying a house ##

After working for several years in Regina, I believe I can be affordable for buying a house in Regina and I can do it via

[properties.mitula.ca](http://properties.mitula.ca)

Through browsing the website, I found that the house price varies greatly between areas and communities. Houses for sale in Regina with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms could be marked a price between $200,000 and $600,000, it can be a challenge for new arrivals like me to buy an ideal home.

Before buying a house, my prospective family and I have to decide how much we can afford, how many rooms we will need, where we would like to live and what type of house we would prefer.

After living in Regina for a few years, I am sure I would find a safe, affordable area to live.

## Working ##

Finding a perfect job in Canada can take time and may be different from finding a job in my home country. But, with my expertise, I believe it would not be hard for me to find a suitable job after my arrival.

### Some resources I can use ###

* I can use the **Working in Canada Tool** ([www.workingincanada.gc.ca](http://www.workingincanada.gc.ca) ) to get information on the Canadian job market.
* I also could use [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) to find an ideal job.

### Gathering Certified Documents ###
I will collect all my certified documents, such as my GPA result, undergraduate diploma, bachelor degree and my current and previous team leader's reference letters.

### My competency ###
As an experienced software programmer, besides the academic training and degree I got in college, I have also acquired abundant developing technologies and related experience in my career life. I am familiar with programming languages, such as C, C++ and Java. I helped developing many software and debugging on multiple operating systems, such as Windows desktop, Windows CE and linux. At present, I have been working on android phone development projects for five years, I have had deep understanding of Android Smartphone's software stack and hardware's architecture. Therefore the most matched job positions for me would be Android related jobs, including the entire platform development or Android application development. I believe that I can  get my desired job in SK.

Canada has two official languages: English and French, and English is the main language spoken in Regina.

Adult education is common in Canada and there are many education programs available for adults. I wish to use adult education to train for a new job or to improve the skills I already have. [The Regina Open Door Society](http://rods.sk.ca/) also can offer me some courses about career skills.

## Health ##

Through surfing the internet, I find that Canada’s health insurance system often referred to as Medicare, is designed to make sure all residents of Canada have reasonable access to health care from doctors and hospitals.

To access health care under this system I must apply a health card first. In order to apply Health Insurance card, I should fill the application form that can be found in an immigrant-serving organization in Saskatchewan.  The required documents also include Permanent Resident Card, Passport, Confirmation of Permanent Residence and so forth.  Then I can apply health card online [http://www.ehealthsask.ca/HealthRegistries/Pages/apply-for-health-card.aspx](http://www.ehealthsask.ca/HealthRegistries/Pages/apply-for-health-card.aspx)

## Family ##

Currently, I still don't have a family, so maybe I will get married in the future in Saskatchewan.

### Getting a marriage certificate###

When I am ready for getting married, I will collect all my and my prospective wife's related documents to get the  Marriage Certificate. This link includes many instructions and tutorials about marriage issues: [http://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/marriages](http://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/marriages).

### Having a baby ###

If we decide to have a baby, we will learn enough knowledge to keep babies healthy. Then I will get the birth certificates, and the helpful instructions from [http://www.ehealthsask.ca/vitalstats/births/ordercertificate/Pages/default.aspx](http://www.ehealthsask.ca/vitalstats/births/ordercertificate/Pages/default.aspx).


## Money ##

I prepared about $13,000 to support my life in the first six months after arriving in Canada. The main cost I assumed is the cost of renting. It also includes electricity, gas, water, telephone, Internet,  food and transportation, etc. Below data is my estimation after investigation on internet:

### Cost per month ###

|*Category*|*Cost*|
|---|:---|
|Renting the apartment|$900|
|Food|$300|
|Public Transportation|$50|
|Internet & Mobile phone|$100|
|Entertainment|$150|
|Clothing|$100|
|For emergancy|$300|
|Other fees|$100|
|Total budget|$2000|


## Connecting ##

Making new friends will help me feel at home in Canada and help me advance my professional goal by creating a network of people who would be helpful in my career life. There are many different ways in which I can connect with others in my new home.

### Sports and Leisure Programs ###

I can join fitness centers or gyms around my community and take advantage of the services offered by Community Associations, including the low-cost exercise, sports and special-interest programs for adults.

### Outdoor Recreation ###

Saskatchewan offers year-round outdoor recreation. Provincial parks in many areas allow camping and picnics. Hunting and fishing are popular outdoor sports. I believe I can make friends in the process of recreation.

### Volunteering ###

I can do volunteer work in many places, such as care-homes where senior citizens live, schools, or for a charity.

I can learn more about volunteer in [volunteer.ca](http://volunteer.ca/)
