# Why  I want to immigrate to Saskatchewan#

## Why choose Canada? ##

Firstly, to be a professional software developer, I have been working for ten years in Beijing. But the air polution in Beijing is very serious, I think that factor would be bad for my future family and myself, especially raising children, and Canada is a ideal place to live and work. Secondly, Canada is the second largest country in the world with many gorgeous landscapes, and without too much population, because I prefer to a more quiet and peaceful life. Lastly, Canada is a free, highly developed country with the great health and welfare programs, and due to many opportunities in the Information Technology sector for software professionals, I can easily find my desired job position. Otherwise, Living in another different country is a extremely challenging thing to accomplish!  Therefore, I pick Canada as my new home.

## About Saskatchewan ##

Saskatchewan is a land of natural beauty that is rich in resources and full of opportunities for study, quality careers, or starting a business. I think Saskatchewan is a great place for me and my future family to call home, and Regina would be the place where we choose to live. Regina’s comfortable size will give me more chances to explore and entertain, whether it’s walking around Wascana Lake, going to the movies or the art gallery, relaxing in the sun at nearby Regina Beach or skiing in the winter, and enjoy the favorite activities---Mosaic, a popular multicultural festival held every spring. It will be a great place to meet other immigrants who live there!

# Before I leave #

Before leaving from China, There are some fundamental learning works need to do.

##Knowing more about Life in Canada ##

As a new immigrant to Canada, it is important to know about Canada’s history, the land, climate, people, government, and laws and justice. We should understand both the rights and responsibilities of the people who live here. It is essential for me to learn rights and responsibilities of living in Saskatchewan as to adapt to the new culture.

### Rights in Canada ###

When I arrive in Canada and begin my new life in Saskatchewan, I will have certain rights and protections under Canadian, provincial and local laws.
Some of those rights and freedoms include:

* The right to life, liberty and personal security
* Freedom of conscience and religion
* Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media
* Protection from unreasonable search or seizure and unjustified detainment and imprisonment
* The right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty
* The right to retain and instruct counsel (a lawyer) without delay

### Responsibilities  ###

Besides rights I will get in Canada, there are also responsibilities I have to take. Therefore I also have legal obligations. It is important to know how the laws affect me in terms of both rights and obligations. The government system and its programs will be of interest to us as I begin to receive benefits and to pay taxes.

### Others ###

Other information about starting life in Canada can be easily accessed in [Welcome to Canada](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/pub/welcome.pdf)

* Have two border crossing interviews. 
* Report to the CBSA if bringing CAN$10,000 or more.

# After landing #

## Immediate to-do list##

When I arrive at the new country, there are some essential things:

* Buy private insurance within five days of arriving, and waiting for health insurance coverage to begin.
* Apply for a public health card.
* Apply for a Social Insurance Number (SIN).
* Open a Canadian bank account and apply for a credit card so I can begin to establish my credit history in Canada.
* Exchange my money for Canadian currency. 
* Get a map of your area and find out about public transportation.

## Renting a house ##

To rent a house is an essential step to have a normal living in Saskatchewan. So I can find it via internet resources:

[properties.mitula.ca](http://properties.mitula.ca)

I will choose an area which is not far away from the university of Regina and Wascana Lake. I may signed one or six months' rental contract. When my full time work is confirmed, I will reconsider the location where I will live.

##  Buying a house ##

This link is also okay for buying a house:

[properties.mitula.ca](http://properties.mitula.ca)

Since housing varies greatly between areas and communities, houses for sale in Regina with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms could be marked a price between $200,000 and $600,000, it can be a challenge for new arrivals like me to buy an ideal home, my budget for buying a home would be around $500,000.

Before buying a home, we have to decide how much we can afford, how many rooms we will need, where we’d like to live and what type of housing my family prefer.

After living in Regina for a while, I am sure I could find a safe, affordable area to live.

## Working ##

Finding a job in Canada can take time and may be different from finding a job in our home country. We need to apply a Social Insurance Number so that I can work and get access to government service. To apply for my Social Insurance Number (SIN), we simply need to gather all the required original proof-of-identity documents and take them to the nearest Service Canada point of service.

### Some resources I can use ###

* I can use the **Working in Canada Tool** ([www.workingincanada.gc.ca](http://www.workingincanada.gc.ca) ) to get information on the Canadian job market.
* I also could use [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) to find my ideal job.

### Gathering Certificated Documents ###
I will collect all my certificated documents, such as college's GPA result, diplomas and my current and previous team leader's reference letters.

### My competency ###
As an experienced software programmer, besides the official engineering training and diplomas I got in college, I have also acquired abundant developing technologies and related experiences in my career life. I am familiar with C, C++ and Java programming languages. I developed softwares and debugged on mutiple operating systems, such as Windows desktop, Windows CE and linux. At present, I have been working on android phone development for five years, I have had the deep understanding of Android Smartphone's software stack and hardware's architecture. Therefore the most matched job position for me is Android related jobs, including the entire platform development or Android application development. I strongly believe that I can  get my desired job in SK.

## Languages issues ##

Canada has two official languages: English and French, and English is the main language spoken in the majority of provinces and territories. I realize that strong skills in languages are very important to my life in Canada, such as getting a job, accessing services, helping your children with school work, as well as meeting and interacting with people. Consider improving my English after arriving in Regina, I have already found some immigrant-serving organizations in the city, and they can help me find the information and services we need to start my new life, including language training and help finding work:

**Regina Open Door Society**
Add: 2332 11th Avenue Regina SK S4P 0K1  
Web: http://www.rods.sk.ca
Telephone: 306-352-3500

**Services**:

Language assessment/Language training (general)/Help with daily life/Find or become a mentor to a newcomer/Services for refugees/Services for Youth

## Education ##

Adult education is common in Canada and there are many education programs available for adults. I wish to use adult education to train for a new job or to improve the skills I already have. [The Regina Open Door Society](http://rods.sk.ca/)  which was mentioned in the previous section also can offer me some courses about career skills.

## Health ##

Canada’s health insurance system is set up to respond to people’s need for health care rather than their ability to pay for it. Often referred to as medicare, the system is designed to make sure that all residents of Canada have reasonable access to health care from doctors and hospitals.

Canada’s public health care system is funded through taxes and administered by the provinces and territories.

To access health care under this system I must apply a health card issued by the government of the province or territory where I live as soon as possible when I arrive Canada. In order to apply Health Insurance card, I should fill the application form that can be found in an immigrant-serving organization in Saskatchewan.  The required documents also include Permanent Resident Card, Passport, Confirmation of Permanent Residence and so forth.  Then I can apply health card online [http://www.ehealthsask.ca/HealthRegistries/Pages/apply-for-health-card.aspx](http://www.ehealthsask.ca/HealthRegistries/Pages/apply-for-health-card.aspx)

## Family ##

Currently, I still don't have a family, so maybe I will get married in the future in Saskatchewan. And the family issues is a long-term process:

### Getting a marriage ###

When I am ready for getting marriage, I will collect all my and my wife's related documents to get the  Marriage Certificate. This link includes many instructions and tutorials about marriage issues: [http://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/marriages](http://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/marriages).

### Having a baby ###

If we decide to have a baby, we will learn enough knowledges to let babies healthy. Then I am going to get the birth certificate, the helpful instruction is from [http://www.ehealthsask.ca/vitalstats/births/ordercertificate/Pages/default.aspx](http://www.ehealthsask.ca/vitalstats/births/ordercertificate/Pages/default.aspx).


## Money ##

I prepare about $13,000 to support me in the first year after we arrive Canada. The main cost I assumed is the cost of renting. It also includes the often-high cost of heating my home and paying for electricity, telephone service, water, food, transportation, etc. Below data is my statistics from my investigations on internet:

### Cost per month ###

|*Item*|*Cost*|
|---|:---|
|Renting the apartment|$900|
|Food|$100|
|Public Transportation|$20|
|Internet & Mobile phone|$60|
|Other fees |$100|
|Entertainment|$150|
|Total budget|$1430|


## Connecting ##

Connecting with others in my new community is an important step in the settlement process. Making new friends and contacts will help me feel at home in Canada and help me advance my professional goals by creating a network of people that can support me in my search for work. There are many different ways in which I can connect with others in my new city or town.

### Sports and Leisure Programs ###

I can join fitness centers in some communities; City neighborhoods are organized into Community Associations that offer low-cost exercise, sports and special-interest programs for adults and children. Classes are usually held in local schools in the evenings.

### Outdoor Recreation ###

Saskatchewan offers year-round outdoor recreation. Provincial parks in many areas allow camping and picnics.  Many communities have parks, play areas and outdoor wading pools for children.  Hunting and fishing are popular outdoor sports, but I must hunt only in certain seasons and follow specific laws that regulate each activity.

### Volunteering ###

When I work as a volunteer, I am donating my time to an organization, person or group of people. I can do volunteer work in many places, such as care-homes where senior citizens live, schools, or for a charity.  My Regional Newcomer Gateway may also be able to help me find opportunities to volunteer.

I can learn more about volunteer in [volunteer.ca](http://volunteer.ca/)
