# Goals #

After studying this course on OCW, these knowledges can be obtained.

- Systems of linear equations
- Row reduction and echelon forms
- Matrix operations, including inverses
- Block matrices
- Linear dependence and independence
- Subspaces and bases and dimensions
- Orthogonal bases and orthogonal projections
- Gram-Schmidt process
- Linear models and least-squares problems
- Determinants and their properties
- Cramer's Rule
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Diagonalization of a matrix
- Symmetric matrices
- Positive definite matrices
- Similar matrices
- Linear transformations
- Singular Value Decomposition

According to the constructure of the course pn OCW, the whole course will be seperated into three components:

- Unit 1: **Ax = b and the Four Subspaces**
- Unit 2: **Least Squares, Determinants and Eigenvalues**
- Unit 3: **Positive Definite Matrices and Applications**

#Unit 1: **Ax = b and the Four Subspaces**#

## The Geometry of Linear Equations ##

**Suggested Reading**

Read Section 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1 in the 4th or 5th edition.
